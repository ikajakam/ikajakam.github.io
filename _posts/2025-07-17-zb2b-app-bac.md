## **B2B apps**

Target :

-   **SaaS platforms for companies**, like:
    
    -   Project management (e.g., Asana, Jira)
        
    -   CRMs (e.g., Salesforce, Zoho)
        
    -   Admin dashboards
        
    -   Invoicing/billing apps
        

**Why?**  
-  B2B apps often have multiple roles and sensitive data — ripe for **BAC misconfigurations**.

## **Get to Know Them**

Before attacking, **immerse yourself** in the app. Treat it like you're onboarding as a real user — and then turn adversarial.

#### **Understand the Roles & Structure**

-   Identify built-in roles (ask docs, register, or inspect UI behavior):
    
    -   `admin`, `user`, `team_member`, `finance`, `support`, `viewer`, `guest`
        
-   Use **two or more accounts** with different roles.
    
    -   Login from separate browsers or incognito windows.
        
-   Observe:
    
    -   What actions are available?
        
    -   What buttons/forms are enabled or hidden?
        
    -   Any changes in the **API calls**, **headers**, or **JSON data**?

#### **Compare API Behavior**

-   Record and diff API calls between roles.
    
-   Example:
    
    -   `admin` performs `GET /api/export_contacts`
        
    -   Try the same with `user` — if it succeeds →  **Vertical BAC!**

```js
GET /api/export_contacts
Authorization: Bearer <user_token>
```

- Expected: `403 Forbidden`  
- If you get: `200 OK` →  **Privilege escalation**

### **Explore Every Page Like a Hacker**

 - **Surf around** each page.  
 - **Click every button**, open every dropdown, try to access all tabs.  
 - **Fill out every form** with edge-case data.  
 - **Trigger every feature/function** and observe :
 
| What to Observe | What to Look For  |
|--|--|
| Error messages |Leaks about internal roles/functions  |
|HTTP status codes| `403`, `401`, `500`, `302`, etc.
|Hidden elements| Grayed-out buttons, disabled fields

### **Think Like an Attacker**

-   “What if I can change the `user_id`?”
    
-   “What if I can edit a role from the client side?”
    
-   “What if I submit a form with extra parameters?”
    
-   “What if I access the same endpoint with another token?”

-- Apps often **reveal more flaws over time** as you gain deeper understanding.

-- You're not just using the app — you're **manipulating it.**

## **Look for BAC: 3 Types per Parameter**

#### A. Vertical BAC

- **Low-privileged user accessing high-privileged function**

**Example :**
```
GET /admin/users
```
-   Should return **403 Forbidden** to normal users.
    
-   But if it returns user data — it's **Vertical BAC**.

#### B. Horizontal BAC

> **Same-level user accessing others’ data**

**Example :**
```
GET /api/invoices/11783
```
Change ID to :
```
GET /api/invoices/11784
```
- If user A sees user B's invoice → **Horizontal BAC**

#### C. Contextual BAC

> **Role allowed in one context misusing permission in another**

**Example :**  
A **support** role is allowed to view tickets, but shouldn't **delete them**.

Try :
```
DELETE /api/tickets/453
```

- If allowed → **Contextual BAC**.

### **Automate Two with Autorize**

Use Burp's Autorize extension to test **Horizontal** and **Vertical BAC**.

#### Setup:

-   Login as **low-privileged user**
    
-   Load high-privileged token (e.g., admin) in Autorize
    
-   Browse the app — it will **test the same requests with another token**
    

**Autorize Example Output :**
``js
[✓] ### Response matches - Access control bypass detected
GET /api/users/3
```
- Automates detection of **missing role checks** and **ID-based flaws**.

### **Check Property-Level Access Manually**

When updating objects, check if unauthorized users can modify **restricted fields**.

**Example :**

```js
PATCH /api/users/3
{
  "email": "attacker@evil.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```
-   A regular user shouldn't be able to **modify roles or organization IDs**.
    
-   If the `role` is updated → serious **Property-Level BAC**.

### Another : 
```
POST /api/invoices
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "client_id": 37,
  "created_by": 1  <-- suspicious field ###################
}
```
### **Curiosities**

Look beyond the normal flow. Look for oddities like :

#### A. **Hidden Fields**

Inspect forms – check if there are disabled inputs like :
```html
<input type="text" name="is_admin" value="false" disabled>
```

- Try enabling it via DevTools → Submit → Check if accepted.

#### B. **Unexpected JSON Fields**

Use Burp/Repeater to add custom fields :
```
PATCH /api/profile
{
  "bio": "hacker",
  "is_verified": true
}
```

- If accepted, the app lacks **field-level validation**

#### C. **Different Behavior per Role**

-   API might expose more data for admins.
    
-   Try calling :
```js
GET /api/users/3
```

- as user and admin — compare responses with **Diff tools**

#### D. **Hidden Endpoints**

-   Try classic admin routes:
    
    -   `/admin/settings`
        
    -   `/internal/config`
        
    -   `/api/v1/users/roles`
        
    -   `/api/audit-logs`
        

Sometimes not linked in UI but **accessible directly**
