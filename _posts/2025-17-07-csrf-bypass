| Technique |Protection Bypassed | Scenario |
|--|--|
|1. Token Reuse or Leak  | Static or predictable CSRF tokens | Token is same across users or pages |
|2. Misconfigured SameSite | SameSite set to None or missing | Cookies sent in cross-origin requests
|3. JSON CSRF | Tokens not enforced on application/json | No CORS preflight + cookies auto-sent
|4. Referer Header Bypass | Server uses referer as CSRF check | Header can be spoofed in some edge cases
|5. CORS Misconfiguration| Trusts Origin without validating Credentials | Requests with cookies from cross-origin go through
|6. Multi-step CSRF | Each request step is CSRF-safe but chain allows state-change | Combine endpoints
|7. Login CSRF | CSRF used on login to set known creds | No anti-CSRF on login form
