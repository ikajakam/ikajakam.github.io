## üéØ 1. State-Changing Endpoints

Look for actions that change data or account settings, not just fetch data.

| Feature | Example Endpoint |
|--|--|
| Change email  | /account/update-email |
| Change password | /account/change-password
| Add/delete SSH keys | /account/ssh-keys/add
| Add credit card | /billing/add-payment
| Enable/disable 2FA | /security/2fa/toggle
| Delete droplets | /droplets/delete
| Add team members| /teams/invite
| Create support ticket | Create support ticket
| Change billing address | /billing/update-address



## üîç 2. How to Discover These Endpoints
### ‚úÖ Using Burp Suite

1.  Log in to (test account).
2.  Enable Burp Proxy and start browsing.
3.  Look in :
    - **HTTP history** ‚Üí filter for `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`
    -   Click each ‚Üí observe payloads (Inspect the payloads and headers for token or referer behavior)

### ‚úÖ Developer Tools

1.  Open browser **DevTools** ‚Üí Network tab
2.  Perform state-changing actions (e.g., change email, create resource, update email, add SSH key)
3.  Filter **XHR** or **Doc**, watch for `POST` requests
4.  Observe whether requests are `POST`, what headers they carry, and if a token is present

### ‚úÖ Check JavaScript / HTML

Look at :

-   Forms: `<form method="post">`
-   JS functions: `fetch('/api/...', { method: 'POST' })` or `axios.post(...)`

## üõë 3. Ignore These (Usually Not Vulnerable to CSRF)

-   `GET`only endpoints that don‚Äôt change data
-   API endpoints requiring complex headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer ...`)
-   Endpoints with strong CSRF tokens + `SameSite=Strict` cookies

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 4. Indicators of Missing/Broken CSRF Protection

| Signal | Meaning |
|--|--|
|No CSRF token in the form or request  | Likely vulnerable |
|Token exists but is static/guessable|Weak protection
|Changing Origin or Referer doesn‚Äôt block request|Missing referer validation (Poor validation)
|Cookie lacks `SameSite` attribute|High CSRF risk (Browser won't help prevent CSRF)

## üß™ 5. Use This Checklist While Testing

-   ‚ùì Does this action **change any data**?
-   üì• Does it use **POST, PUT, or DELETE**?
-   üîê Is a **CSRF token present**?
-   üß© Can you **remove/bypass/strip the token**?
-   üåê Are there **origin/referer checks**?
-   üç™ Is **SameSite cookie enforced**?

## üß† 6. Smart Tip : Look in the Account, Billing and Security Settings First

**These are often :**

-   Behind auth
-   Have critical impact
-   Sometimes overlooked in CSRF protection
-   Deal with sensitive actions
-   Require authentication

> Also test old UI endpoints, legacy APIs, or mobile API routes ‚Äî these are sometimes reused without CSRF tokens.

## ‚úÖ Next Step for You

-   **Account Settings** ‚Üí try changing email, password, SSH keys
-   **Billing** ‚Üí try adding/editing payment methods
-   **API** ‚Üí check token creation/removal
-   **Support** ‚Üí try creating or deleting support tickets

‚û°Ô∏è Set **Burp** to intercept these actions and try removing tokens / crafting PoC forms to test.

**While hunting on a live scope, If you test CSRF on :**

-   `/api/*` endpoints requiring Bearer tokens ‚Äî **waste of time**
-   Static pages or read-only GET requests ‚Äî **no value**
-   Well-protected forms using CSRF tokens & SameSite cookies ‚Äî **already mitigated**

**Focus instead on :**

-   **Actions using POST/PUT/DELETE** endpoints
-   **Logged-in user actions**
-   **Endpoints/Forms missing CSRF tokens**
-   **Legacy panels / old routes** still in use
-   Routes that **work without origin/referer validation**

## ‚úÖ Final Tip

**When testing CSRF :**

-   Use **DevTools** or **Burp** to observe the real HTTP request.
-   Capture **what request happens** when you change something
-   Ask :
    -   Is it POST/PUT/DELETE?
    -   Is it **state-changing**?
    -   Is a CSRF token present?
    -   Are `SameSite` attributes set?
    -   Can I trigger this from another origin?
