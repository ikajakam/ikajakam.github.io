While exploring a _program’s_ Container Registry, we found a simple yet impactful flaw:
A **read-only token** could **delete a Docker image** — something that shouldn’t happen if token permissions were enforced strictly.



### Reproduction Flow

-   Created a simple Dockerfile
-   Logged in using a **read-write token**
-   Pushed the image to the registry
-   Logged out and back in with a **read-only token**
-   Ran `docker image rm`  — **and it worked**

### Takeaway

This wasn’t a complex bug — but **where** we found it was deep. We didn’t just test endpoints. We **tested logic**, **token scopes**, **expected vs. real behavior.** We tested **everything** related to token permissions — the actions most people skip.

Interestingly, our submission was **initially marked as out of scope.** But after **referring the triager to the program’s official documentation and scope guidelines**, the triager acknowledged the oversight and **triaged the issue** properly.

> 🔍 **Always test beyond expectations. Explore every corner. Push your logic.**

That mindset is what turned a basic functionality check into a **_$1,390_ bounty**.

### Grind Behind the Scenes

We spent **13 straight days**, averaging **10+ hours a day**, hunting through every functionality this program offered.

**The result?**

> 💰**$6,000+ minted** from this one program on **Intigriti**

-   🟢 **6 Accepted**
-   🟡 **2 Duplicates**
-   🔴 **4 Rejected**
-   🔵 **1 Informational**

### 🧠 Final Note

Bug bounty isn’t just about being “technical.” It’s about **thinking deeper**, being curious, and chasing **unexpected behaviors**.

**When you give your 100%, even simple bugs pay big.**

> Easy bugs. Hard-earned bounties. Deep testing mindset.
